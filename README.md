# Production_Monitoring
A toolkit, that gets the remaining production volume, WIP-goods and shows them on a local html-file.
Target is a manual, daily update via Email, since I don't want to use the company-network and have no access to the ERP for such a short-term project.

I didn't add the credentials.json and the token.pickle for the Google OAuth-Service for obvious reasons.
You get the credentials from the Google API-dashboard, where you need to register for the Gmail-API.
